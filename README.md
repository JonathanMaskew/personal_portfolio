## Personal Portfolio

I put my full dedication into everything I do to achieve the best possible output. Everything I do is done with care and I put immense thought into every detail. Why should it be this way? How should it be done? How will this scale and adapt?

This passion, of course, is present in this very site...

### Layout

The point of the site is to showcase my accomplishments. Nothing is inherently more important than another; it's all contributing to the same goalâ€”gaining an understanding of, well, me. So why separate it into pages? Therefore, we've got a single, scrollable page that highlights various aspects of my accomplishments, providing a holistic view of me.

### Colors

Again, the most important aspect of this site is the content within it. Therefore, I chose the color scheme to reflect that, with each color reflective of the corresponding data. This makes each chunk of content feel unified, helping to differentiate it from similar content within a single page. I strategically used gradients on content I wanted to draw more attention to. The dark background is intended to bring a sense of professionalism and helps the colors to pop.

### Interactivity

Little interactions and animations make the site feel friendly, engaging, and lively. Hovering over content makes it apparent what is interactable. Little animations when interacting provide clarity and a sense of flow.

### Usability

My intention with this site was not to shove it full of fancy technologies, contrarian user interface choices, or complex interactivity. My goal was to create a site that was practical and intuitive, that, again, prioritized the content. Of course, that doesn't mean the site couldn't be beautiful, interactive, and engaging.

### Responsiveness

I knew this site would likely be viewed on a variety of devices. In professional contexts, it may be viewed on desktop. However, in many instances, especially if sending a link, it may be viewed on a phone. Therefore, I built the site to not only be fully responsive, but to be optimized for mobile vs desktop viewing. For example, on desktop you get a sidebar for navigation and hover effects. On mobile, you get a top navigation bar.

### Technology

I built the site with Next.js, knowing that it's a popular, modern framework, perfect for a front-end portfolio. I also used Tailwind CSS to style items efficiently. I think AI is a very powerful tool, and I believe it should be used as a tool, not a replacement. All design decisions and all content are my own. Any AI contributions to the code were well-understood, vetted, and adapted, with AI being used more as an assistant, rather than a developer.

### Never Complete

As various experiences continue to shape me, this site will continue to evolve.
